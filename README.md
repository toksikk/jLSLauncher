# jLSLauncher - Livestreamer launching utility (discontinued)
### Download

A pre-compiled `.jar`-file can be downloaded here: https://dev.ixab.de/da/jLSLauncher/raw/master/out/artifacts/jLSLauncher_jar/jLSLauncher.jar

### Required Software

* Java (minimum required is v7) - https://www.java.com/de/download/
* [Livestreamer](https://docs.livestreamer.io/install.html)

### Installation

`jLSLauncher.jar` does not need an installation and can be executed as is.  
You can move or copy this tool to any other location you like.  
After the first launch the configuration is stored in a file named `config.json` which, if present, has to be moved to the same location.

### Usage

Double click `jLSLauncher.jar`.
If there is no program associated to launching `*.jar` files, jLSLauncher has to be launched via console/shell with the following commands:
* Windows: `java -jar X:\Pfad\zu\jLSLauncher.jar`
* Linux: `java -jar /pfad/zu/jLSLauncher.jar`

At the first start of jLSLauncher a *Open file* dialog is displayed. You'll have to point this to the `livestreamer` executable.

Please use the Issue-Tracker.

For detailed debug output, please start jLSLauncher via console or shell.
